Model numbers for AMD Opteron processors are different from model numbers for Athlon 64 FX and Athlon XP/MP, Sempron and Athlon 64 processors. Opteron model number consists of three or four digits and optional two-character modifier. The first digit in Opteron model number designates processor scalability: 

1xx and 1xxx processors can be used in uniprocessor servers and workstations. 
Processors with 2xx and 2xxx model numbers can be used in 1 or 2-processor servers and workstations. 
Processors with 8xx and 8xxx model numbers can be used in 8-processor or less than 8-processor servers. 
Second digit in 4-digit model number indicates generation of Opteron processors. For example, Opteron 8350 belongs to Third Generation Opteron family. 

The remaining digits make up the number that indicates relative processor performance. The higher this number is the greater processor's performance (this doesn't apply when CPUs with 3-digit models numbers are compared to CPUs with 4-digit model numbers). 

Optional two characters after the model number indicate processor's power features: 

EE - 30 Watt maximum power. 
HE - 55 Watt maximum power for socket 939 and socket 940 processors, 65 Watt for socket AM2 CPUs, 68 Watt for dual-core socket F processors, 79 Watt for quad-core socket F processors. 
SE - High power consumption
