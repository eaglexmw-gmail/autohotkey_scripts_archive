Update 2010-02-15:
Unless explicitly marked otherwise, any original script I write and post or have written and posted in these forums may be considered public domain. If parts are derived from scripts written by others, those parts may be copyright their respective authors. I will attempt to identify such parts if they are present, typically with a name and/or URL.

In other words: use, modify, distribute, etc. my scripts however you like.

A while back, I wrote:
I've always felt that attaching explicit licenses detracts from my posts, so this thread is here to remove any doubt about how my scripts may be used, and to save me answering should someone ask. Since the zlib license is very close to my own views, I've used it as a base.

Obviously if I post a script which is not entirely my own work, the original author's terms also apply. (If I post such a script and don't mention the original author, feel free to berate me.)


Unless otherwise noted, the following license may be applied to any script I have posted or will post in Scripts & Functions:

This may also be applied to any script I have posted or will post in Ask for Help, except that restrictions 1 and 2 are optional. Wink
