Function: MD5_File( sFile="", cSz=4 )

    sFile   - The fullpath of filename to hash
    cSz     - *Chunk size factor. Values accepted are 0 thru 8. Default value is 4
    
    * To hash large files, the function has to read the file in manageable chunks into a buffer variable.
    The size of this buffer is derived from cSz parameter as follows:
    
    0 = 256 KB, 1 = 512 KB, 2 = 1.00 MB, 3 = 2.00 MB, 4 = 4.00 MB, 5 = 8.00 MB, 6 = 16.0 MB, 7 = 32.0 MB, 8 = 64.0 MB

Function: MD5( ByRef V, L=0 )

    V - Variable string from which to calculate the md5 hash.
    L - Size of the string from V.
    
    > ; Usage Example
    > V := "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
    > L := StrLen(V)
    > MsgBox, % MD5( V,L )
