Function: QPX( N=0 )

    N - 0 means Initialise Counter
        1 means Retrieve Time consumed ( & reset internal vars )

    To initilize the counter, call QPX(true). Then do some action and if you are done and want see 
    the difference, then call time:=QPX(false). The return value contains the time between first call 
    and the second call. 

    Return:
    The resulting time is a floating point with 6 digits after the dot (milliseconds and thousandstal 
    of milliseconds). In example: 1.234567

    Example:   
    > time := QPX( N=0 )
