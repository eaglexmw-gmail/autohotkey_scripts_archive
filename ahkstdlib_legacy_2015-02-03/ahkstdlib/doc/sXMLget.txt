    * For the best results, make sure all characters are escaped properly (&lt; &gt; &quot; etc) and that tags are closed in the same order they are opened. 
    * Supports getting the values from a nested nodes; does NOT support decendant/ancestor or sibling.
    * Should be used at simple and standard xml and html strings only.
