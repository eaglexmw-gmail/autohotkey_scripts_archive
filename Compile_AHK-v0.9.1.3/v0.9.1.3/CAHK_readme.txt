Info
----

Compile AHK is a GUI based script that assists with compiling AutoHotkey scripts.

OS Support: Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.x
Tested On: Windows 7, Windows 8.x


Bugs/Issues
-----------

-This version of Compile AHK is intended for use with AutoHotkey_L v1.1.01.00 and higher.  For AutoHotkey Basic or AutoHotkey_L v1.1.00.01 and lower use Compile CHK v0.9.0.50/58.
-Icon files contained in very long directory paths will generate errors when they are selected.  This issue is currently under investigation for a future release.

Please report any bugs/issues you encounter and I will do my best to fix them.
