	<h4>Links</h4>

	<p>Links work as you would expect, you can have links to web sites outside of your aplication. Such as <a href="http://www.gipsysoft.com/">this one</a>. Of course images work as links too, such as the animated image on the top-right.

	<h4>Link tips</h4>
	Hyperlinks get tooltips displayed which by default is the URL. You can override this by specifying a <code>title=""</code>. For example <a href="COMMAND:MSGBOX" title="<b>HTML Message Box</b><br>Click the link to see HTML message box in action">this link will display</a> the HTML message box in action but the link is internal and is quite ugly. Hover the mouse cursor over the link to see what happens. You can even have HTML in the tooltips!

	<h4>Colours</h4>
	Links can have colour. You are free to use the BODY ALINK, VLINK and LINK attributes as well as adding colour for inidvidual links; <p><a href="#bottom"><b>Click <font color="red">here</font></b></a> to view the bottom of this HTML file.
	
	<h4>Internal links</h4>
	<p>Links can also be interpreted internally so rather than opening a web browser they do something inside your application.
	<p><a href="#bottom"><b>Click here</b></a> to view the bottom of this HTML file.

	<p>And links can be used to navigate to other parts of a document. This requires no callback and QHTM handles everything.
	<p><a href="#top"><b>Click here</b></a> to go back up to the top.
