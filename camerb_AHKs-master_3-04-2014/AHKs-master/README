This is Camerb's repo of AHKs that make his life easier.
Maybe you can take parts of them and make your life easier,
too. This repo is open source, so have fun with the code
here. Don't try to sell this code, cause it's free, but if
this code just happens to help you be more productive and
it makes you some money, that's perfectly fine.

FYI: I run vanilla AHK (AKA AHK_basic from autohotkey.com).
I don't run any of the variants, like AHK_L or AHK_v2, but
I do dabble a little with IronAHK on my CR-48 running Ubuntu.
All of the scripts in this repo run on either Win7 or WinXP 
with AHK_basic but about 90% of the scripts here will not
run using IronAHK (just sayin').

Come to #ahk on irc.freenode.net to discuss or ask for help.
